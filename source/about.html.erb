					<p>
						Our vision was to create a place for families and locals to come to eat. 
						In the beautifull town of Middletown Ca, we found it challenging to find a family-friendly place 
						to get delicious fresh food.
						We wanted to provide friends and neighbors with the original form of social networking-  
						a fun, easygoing restaurant, and a cold beer.
						We believe in providing exceptional quality products with friendly service in a clean and 
						welcoming setting and that is what has helped us earn the reputation among the locals 
						as one of the best hidden gems in Middletown.
